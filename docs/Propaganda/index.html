            <h2>What is Comic Sans MS known for?</h2>
            <p>
                Comic Sans MS is a font famous for being overly used back in the day, and is viewed by the flock of sheep<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> in a negative fasion.
                It was commonly used because the people that now hate it, used to love how <em>round</em> and <em>clean</em><sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> it looked.
                <br>
                <br>
                They are <strong><em>traitors</em></strong> to the glory that is <em>Comic Sans MS</em>!
                <br>
                Comic Sans MS is the best font and there is nothing they can do about it. 
                No matter how much misinformation they spread, it will remain as the best font in the world!
